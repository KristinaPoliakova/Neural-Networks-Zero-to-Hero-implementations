# Neural-Networks-Zero-to-Hero-implementations

This repository contains my implementation of concepts from Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero course](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html). The goal is to provide a clear, well-documented codebase that follows along with the course lectures.

## Course Structure

The implementations follow these core topics:

- Micrograd: Neural Networks & Backpropagation
- Makemore: Basic Language Modeling
- Makemore: Multi-Layer Perceptron
- Makemore: Advanced NN Concepts
- Makemore: Backpropagation Deep Dive
- Makemore: WaveNet Implementation
- GPT: Core Implementation
- GPT: Tokenizer

## Repository Organization

Each lecture has its own directory with:

- Implementation code in jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations
- Examples and experiments
- Additional notes and insights
